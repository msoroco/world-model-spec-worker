# Traffic-law ontology — atoms

Status: frozen. Changed only by an explicit ontology change, never by a rule and never by an
agent.

## What an atom is

An **atom** is an element of the road world that traffic law refers to without defining it
further and that a data source can observe: a class of road user, a quantity of motion, a piece
of road structure, a control device and its state, a signal a road user emits, a condition of the
environment, or a relation between two road users. Each atom has a **semantic contract** — what
it denotes physically, its unit and its reference frame, and, where the meaning invites
confusion, what it is **not a stand-in for**. The contract is independent of any data source and
of any statute.

A standard of judgement ("safe", "reasonable", "practicable") is **not** an atom: nothing in a
scene is a reasonableness. §8 says how a rule gives such a standard a concrete meaning.

## The termination rule

This file is the whole termination rule. It has six clauses; the harness and the review phase
enforce them, and nothing else adds to or bypasses them.

1. **Closed set.** A rule reads the world only through the atoms of §1–§7, the primitives of
   §10, and the concepts the pipeline has accepted (§9). An element a clause needs that none of
   these carries is an ontology change request, filed as a gap; it is never approximated by
   another atom, and it is never absorbed as a residue on a span that decides when the rule
   applies. A residue records only what the obligation side says and the rule does not capture.
2. **Contract-bound.** An atom expresses only what its contract says. The "not a stand-in for"
   clauses are part of the contract; using an atom for what its contract excludes is a semantic
   error, whatever the data source happens to make convenient.
3. **Defined once.** A concept — a manoeuvre, a state of motion, a road configuration — is a
   node of the pipeline: a contract and a body over atoms, primitives and other concepts, accepted
   like a rule, called by id and never rebuilt inline. A primitive (§10) is a computation the
   formula language cannot express, defined once in Core with its parameters exposed. A rule
   instantiates parameters; it never redefines either.
4. **A judgement standard is operationalized, never read.** A clause element that is a standard
   of judgement is bounded, in the plan, by concepts and primitives with parameters the reading
   sets, and the bound is recorded as an *operationalization claim* that names the standard,
   the concepts, the parameters and the convention their values come from. A rule that leaves a
   standard unoperationalized is not a rule; a rule whose only content is an operationalized
   standard is a **surrogate** and is marked as one.
5. **Legal region classes are assumptions.** Categories a jurisdiction defines administratively
   (a district, an area class, a calendar or clock condition, a legal designation of a highway)
   enter a formalization only as reading assumptions declared per map or per trace, never as
   atoms a rule reads from a scene.
6. **Unobserved is unknown.** Every atom is three-valued when observed — true, false, or *not
   observed on this source* — as declared by that source's capability manifest. A rule built on
   an unobserved atom reports `unknown`, never compliance and never violation.

**How atoms are reached from a clause.** Mapping the elements of a clause onto atoms is the
planning session's work — the linguistic half of autoformalization. Each planned node records
its mappings as *grounding claims* (`elements`: clause element → atoms, with a justification that
cites the contracts) and its *operationalization claims* (§8). The harness validates them before
any rule is written: every atom named exists here; the same element maps to the same atoms in
every node of the run, so a contradiction is rejected; and the run's mapping index, which the
harness derives from the accepted nodes, is what the review phase and its calibration read. No
agent writes a shared file, and nothing about a corpus is decided before the run that formalizes
it.

This file says nothing about which law refers to which atom and nothing about how any data
source produces one. Which atoms a source can observe is declared at run time by that source's
**capability manifest**, one capability per atom: `exact`, `estimate` (with a named error
class), `absent`, or `subject` — observed for the subject track only, as an instrumented vehicle
or a simulator reports its own controls and its own line of sight and nobody else's. Under
`subject` a read of the atom for any other road user is unknown.

**Scope column.** `general` marks an element of the ordinary road vocabulary. `local` marks an
element that exists because the target jurisdiction's own vehicle taxonomy or device catalogue
names it; its contract still describes what is physically observed, and a source that has no such
thing declares it `absent`. The flag is information for the manifest author and the reviewer, not
a permission: local atoms are atoms.

Identifier scheme: `family.name`. Families: `ru` road user, `kin` kinematics, `st` road
structure, `dev` control device, `sig` emitted signal, `env` environment, `rel` relation between
road users. Derived concepts use `drv`. Where an atom carries an attribute (a state, a kind, a
colour), the attribute's values are listed in the contract; an attribute value not listed is an
ontology change request.

## 1. Road users (`ru`) — class atoms on an entity

| id | contract | scope |
|---|---|---|
| `ru.motor_vehicle` | a self-propelled vehicle other than a rail vehicle; excludes the powered two-wheelers a jurisdiction classes separately below **Not a stand-in for:** "vehicle" as a legal aggregate — which classes count as a vehicle is declared by the reading | general |
| `ru.motorcycle` | motor vehicle on two or three wheels ridden astride, including three-wheeled variants | general |
| `ru.moped` | a low-power two- or three-wheeler with a small engine or motor, as a jurisdiction classes it | general |
| `ru.bus` | motor vehicle designed to carry many passengers | general |
| `ru.transit_bus` | bus in public transit service, identifiable by its livery or route display | general |
| `ru.school_bus` | bus designated for carrying school children, with the jurisdiction's markings | general |
| `ru.taxicab` | passenger vehicle for hire, identifiable by its markings | general |
| `ru.tour_bus_or_limousine` | a tour or shuttle bus, or a lengthened passenger vehicle for hire, identifiable by its livery | local |
| `ru.truck` | motor vehicle for carrying goods, with a body built for that purpose | general |
| `ru.commercial_motor_vehicle` | vehicle over the jurisdiction's commercial mass class or marked as commercially licensed | general |
| `ru.trailer_or_combination` | vehicle drawn by another, or the combination | general |
| `ru.bicycle` | human-powered wheeled vehicle ridden by a person | general |
| `ru.electric_bicycle` | a bicycle with an assisting electric motor; **class** attribute as the jurisdiction's taxonomy labels it | local |
| `ru.electric_scooter` | a standing or seated electric scooter with handlebars | local |
| `ru.pedestrian` | a person on foot, in a wheelchair, or on a device the jurisdiction treats as on foot **Not a stand-in for:** a person on a bicycle or scooter | general |
| `ru.pedestrian_with_white_cane_or_guide_animal` | pedestrian carrying a white or white-and-red cane, accompanied by a guide animal, or led by another person | general |
| `ru.child` | pedestrian who is visibly a child | general |
| `ru.emergency_vehicle` | vehicle of a class the jurisdiction designates as emergency; **kind** ∈ {police, fire, ambulance, other} **Not a stand-in for:** a responding emergency vehicle — the class alone is not responding; use `drv.responding_emergency`, and an unobserved lamp or siren makes the rule unknown, not satisfied | general |
| `ru.fire_apparatus` | a fire-fighting vehicle (a sub-kind of `ru.emergency_vehicle` that law names on its own) | general |
| `ru.official_vehicle` | a vehicle in official or contracted road service, identifiable by livery or equipment; **kind** ∈ {tow, utility, highway_maintenance, incident_management, regulatory_agency, coroner, armored_car, municipal, other} **Not a stand-in for:** an emergency vehicle | general (kinds `incident_management`, `regulatory_agency`, `armored_car`: local) |
| `ru.rail_vehicle` | a train, tram, streetcar or other on-track equipment | general |
| `ru.occupant_count` | the number of persons in or on a vehicle (an integer attribute of a road user). A source that observes a change in it — a person arriving at or leaving a vehicle — but not a total, declares the count absent: what it observes then is the arrival or the departure, which is not this atom | general |
| `ru.rider_posture` | how a rider sits and holds the machine: **on_seat**, **hands_on_controls** (count), **standing_on_deck**, **holding_another_vehicle**, **stunt** (a wheel off the ground, a person on the handlebars). The fields are independent: a source declares each on its own, and one that renders a rider as part of the machine, so that no field can vary, declares all of them absent. **hands_on_controls** is a count and is the field a source is least likely to carry **Not a stand-in for:** a manoeuvre, or an arm signal, which is `sig.hand_signal` | general |
| `ru.subject` | the road user whose conduct a rule judges (the ego) | general |
| `ru.aggregate` | membership of a legal aggregate: the atom's literal argument is an aggregate id, `<definition id>::<term>` for the posted definition that applies, or `<law id>:<span>::<term>` for a definition the law itself makes, and the run's reading classifies every road-user class under that id as included, excluded or unresolved by the definition's words; true when the user carries an included class, unknown when no included class holds and the user carries an unresolved class or a class it might carry is unobserved, false otherwise **Not a stand-in for:** a class the text names on its own (a bus, a taxicab) — a named class is its own atom; nor for a role the text describes (responding, overtaking) — a role is a derived concept | general |

"Vehicle", "traffic" and "driver" as legal aggregates are carried by `ru.aggregate` with the word
as its argument: which classes a jurisdiction counts under each is declared by the reading, never
expanded into a class list by a rule. A responding emergency
vehicle is the derived concept `drv.responding_emergency`.

## 2. Kinematics and control state (`kin`) — measurements on any road user, and the inputs to a vehicle's controls

| id | contract | unit / frame | scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kin.time` | instant of observation of a scene | ms, monotone within a trace | general |
| `kin.position` | position of the body's reference point | m, world frame (map or local) | general |
| `kin.heading` | direction the body points | unit vector, world frame | general |
| `kin.velocity` | velocity vector | m/s, world frame | general |
| `kin.speed` | magnitude of velocity | m/s | general |
| `kin.accel_longitudinal` | acceleration along heading, signed **Not a stand-in for:** speed | m/s² | general |
| `kin.yaw_rate` | rate of change of heading, positive when the heading turns to the left (counter-clockwise) **Not a stand-in for:** road curvature — a vehicle yaws on a straight road whenever it manoeuvres | deg/s | general |
| `kin.extent` | the body's size along its axes about the reference point: a trace writes the half-length, half-width and half-height; a formula reads the full length, width and height, twice each | m | general |
| `kin.steer_angle` | front-wheel steering angle. A source often carries it for the road user whose conduct is judged and not for the others; the capability is declared for the atom, not per road user, so a source that supplies it for the subject alone declares `subject` and one that cannot supply it at all declares it absent **Not a stand-in for:** road geometry, a turn, a lane change or any other manoeuvre — a steering input is not a path and not a road | deg | general |
| `kin.path_length` | distance travelled along the body's path since the start of the trace, monotone | m | general |
| `kin.engine_running` | the vehicle's engine or motor is running, so that propulsion is available **Not a stand-in for:** motion or a halt — a vehicle stands with its engine running and rolls with it stopped | — | general |
| `kin.parking_brake` | the parking brake (hand brake) is set **Not a stand-in for:** the service brake (`kin.service_brake`) or the brake lamp (`sig.brake_lamp`) — a set parking brake lights no lamp and a pressed pedal sets no parking brake | — | general |
| `kin.gear` | the gear selected: negative for reverse, zero for neutral, positive for a forward gear **Not a stand-in for:** the direction of motion — a vehicle in a forward gear rolls backwards on a grade; backing is read from kinematics | gear number, signed | general |
| `kin.throttle` | the accelerator input, as the fraction of its full travel that is applied **Not a stand-in for:** acceleration (`kin.accel_longitudinal`) — the input is what the driver does, the acceleration is what the body does | ratio | general |
| `kin.service_brake` | the service brake (foot brake) input, as the fraction of its full travel that is applied **Not a stand-in for:** deceleration or the brake lamp — the lamp is what other road users see, the input is what the driver does | ratio | general |

The control-state atoms are observed on an instrumented vehicle — a simulator's own vehicle, a
vehicle with a data recorder. A source that observes them on the subject's vehicle alone declares
them `subject`; a source that observes none declares them absent, and a rule that reads one then
reports unknown.

## 3. Road structure (`st`) — map-level atoms and occupancy

| id | contract | scope |
|---|---|---|
| `st.highway` | the entire public way between its boundary lines, including sidewalks and shoulders **Not a stand-in for:** the roadway | general |

| `st.lane` | a longitudinal strip of roadway for one line of vehicles **Not a stand-in for:** a half of the roadway or a lateral position within a lane — lane membership is not an offset from the edge, and lane ordinal equals roadway half only on a two-lane road | general |
| `st.lane_direction` | direction of travel a lane is designated for | general |
| `st.lane_adjacency` | left / right neighbouring lane of the same direction; lane ordinal within the carriageway and the count of lanes in that direction; ordinal 1 is the leftmost lane, looking along the lane's direction **Not a stand-in for:** the marking between two lanes | general |
| `st.lane_connectivity` | which lane a lane leads into | general |
| `st.lane_enters` | relation: the intersection region a lane runs into at its end — the lane is an approach to that intersection **Not a stand-in for:** the lane a lane leads into (`st.lane_connectivity`), the subject's presence in the intersection (`rel.occupies`), or the region a device governs (`dev.governs`) — a device governs a lane and the lane enters an intersection; which intersection a device controls is read through both | general |
| `st.on_way` | relation: the public way (a `highway` region) a structure region lies on — a lane, roadway, shoulder, crosswalk, stop line, median or any other part of it; an intersection lies on every way that meets there **Not a stand-in for:** nearness to a way (`st.region_geometry`), or the lane a lane leads into (`st.lane_connectivity`) | general |
| `st.lane_marking` | per side of a lane: **type** ∈ {none, broken, solid, double_solid, solid_broken, dotted, curb}, **colour** ∈ {white, yellow, other} | general |

| `st.crosswalk` | marked crossing, or the unmarked prolongation of sidewalks at an intersection; **marked** attribute | general |
| `st.stop_line` | the transverse line marking where vehicles halt for a device | general |
| `st.driveway_or_alley_entrance` | private road, alley or driveway meeting the highway | general |
| `st.alley` | a narrow way within a block serving the rear of properties | general |
| `st.curvature` | horizontal curvature of the roadway at a point, as a magnitude (1/m, never negative): a bend to either hand has the same value | general |
| `st.grade` | longitudinal slope of the roadway at a point **Not a stand-in for:** the place of a crest (`st.crest`) — the slope where a road user is says nothing of a crest ahead of it | general |
| `st.crest` | the place on a roadway's longitudinal profile where the slope changes from rising to falling in the direction of travel, carried as a region with a reference point and a boundary, so the ground distance from a road user to it is read through `st.region_geometry` **Not a stand-in for:** the slope at a point (`st.grade`), the view a crest restricts (`st.sight_distance`), or a horizontal bend (`st.curvature`) | general |
| `st.sight_distance` | the distance along the road within which a vehicle at a point and another vehicle on the road could see each other, from the eye of either driver to the body of the other vehicle at the height convention the source declares: both the view of approaching traffic from that point and its being seen by drivers approaching it, whether or not any road user is there **Not a stand-in for:** whether an actual road user saw, or could see, another at an observation (`rel.visible`), or the clarity of the air (`env.visibility`) | general |
| `st.sight_along_way` | the distance along a way, in each direction from the point of that way nearest a road user, within which another vehicle on that way could be seen from the road user's eye at the observation, at the height convention the source declares; the smaller of the two directions; m **Not a stand-in for:** the sight distance of the place the road user is at (`st.sight_distance`), or whether an actual road user is seen (`rel.visible`) | general |
| `st.railway_crossing` | level crossing of a railway with the roadway, and its nearest rail | general |

| `st.bicycle_lane_or_path` | lane or separate path reserved for bicycles and the devices a jurisdiction groups with them | general |
| `st.reserved_lane` | lane reserved for a class of vehicles; **class** ∈ {high_occupancy, bus, heavy_vehicle, other} | general (class `high_occupancy` with occupancy and hours conditions: local) |
| `st.centre_turn_lane` | a single centre lane used only for turning by traffic in both directions | local |

| `st.lane_width` | width of a lane at a point | general |
| `st.region_geometry` | the reference point and the boundary polygon of a structure region in the world frame, and the ground distance from a road user's body outline to it (zero when they overlap); a source that maps regions without their outline declares it absent, and every such distance is then unknown **Not a stand-in for:** occupancy — a footprint inside a boundary is `rel.occupies`, which a source may observe without geometry | general |
| `st.obstruction` | a physical object on or beside the roadway that is not a road user; **kind** ∈ {debris, excavation, hose, barrier, stalled_vehicle_wreckage, sidewalk_fixture, mail_drop_box, other} | general |
| `rel.occupies` | a road user's footprint overlaps a lane / region (roadway, shoulder, sidewalk, intersection, crosswalk, stop line, safety zone, bicycle lane, median, alley, curb zone, controlled-access lane, structure) | general |

## 4. Control devices (`dev`) — class, state, position, governance

| id | contract | scope |
|---|---|---|
| `dev.traffic_signal` | a signal head; **state** ∈ {circular_green, circular_yellow, circular_red, green_arrow(dir), yellow_arrow(dir), red_arrow(dir), flashing_yellow_arrow(dir), flashing_red, flashing_yellow, dark, unknown} with dir ∈ {left, right, straight, u_turn}; several states may be displayed at once; **uncovered** attribute for an installed head whose faces are not covered | general (state `flashing_yellow_arrow`: local) |

| `dev.zone_sign` | a sign that begins or ends a signed zone along the road; **kind** ∈ {school, school_crossing, pedestrian_safety, temporary_traffic_control, no_passing, high_occupancy_lane, heavy_vehicle_lane, speed_zone, narrow_highway, hazardous_place, parking_restricted, trail}; **end** attribute; **conditions** attribute: a structured reading of the sign's legend — a list of time windows (a set of weekdays or a calendar class such as school days, a start and an end time of day), a minimum occupancy, a duration limit, a vehicle class, or a "when children present" flag; a legend read with no restriction is the empty set (unconditional), a legend not read is absent (every condition unknown) **Not a stand-in for:** whether the condition holds now — that is `prim.conditions_hold` | general (kinds `school_crossing`, `pedestrian_safety`, `high_occupancy_lane`: local) |
| `dev.railway_signal_or_gate` | the devices at a level crossing; **lights** ∈ {flashing, dark}; **gate** ∈ {up, lowering, down, raising, none}; **bell** attribute | general |
| `dev.temporary_traffic_control` | cones, barricades, temporary signs and flashers marking works, a closure or an obstruction | general |
| `dev.human_direction` | a person directing traffic and the direction given; **role** ∈ {police_officer, flagger, school_crossing_guard, railroad_flagger}; **indication** ∈ {stop, proceed, slow, turn(dir)} | general |
| `dev.school_bus_signal` | the school bus's own devices; **red_flashing**, **amber_flashing**, **stop_arm** attributes | general |
| `dev.governs` | relation: the device applies to a lane, approach or region (which traffic it faces) **Not a stand-in for:** a position — the region a device acts on is not where a halt is required and not the intersection region | general |
| `dev.position` | location of the device head / sign face **Not a stand-in for:** a stop line or a crossing — the distance to a signal head is a different quantity from the distance to the line or region | general |
| `dev.inoperative` | a signal head installed and uncovered but showing no valid indication | general |

## 5. Signals emitted by road users (`sig`)

| id | contract | scope |
|---|---|---|
| `sig.turn_indicator` | the turn indicator **state** ∈ {off, left, right}: neither indicator lit, or the left or the right one **Not a stand-in for:** the turn or lane change itself — the indicator is the signal that precedes a manoeuvre, judged separately from it | general |
| `sig.brake_lamp` | brake lamps lit **Not a stand-in for:** a halt or a deceleration — a lamp is an actuation; the motion state is `kin.velocity` / `kin.accel_longitudinal` | general |
| `sig.hazard` | both indicators flashing together | general |
| `sig.headlamp` | headlamp **state** ∈ {off, low_beam, high_beam} | general |
| `sig.position_lamp` | position, parking, cowl or tail lamps lit (the lamps a vehicle shows without its headlamps) | general |
| `sig.compression_brake` | an engine compression brake sounding (audible; a source without audio declares it absent) | general |
| `sig.reverse_lamp` | reversing lamps lit | general |
| `sig.warning_lamp` | a warning lamp lit; **colour** ∈ {red, blue, amber, white}, **mode** ∈ {flashing, rotating, steady}, **facing** ∈ {front, rear, side} **Not a stand-in for:** an audible warning | general (steady blue rear lamps and amber-lamp roles: local) |
| `sig.siren` | a siren, whistle or bell sounding (audible; a source without audio declares it absent, and does not read a warning lamp as the sound — the two are separable and a road user may show one without the other) | general |
| `sig.horn` | an ordinary horn or a rail vehicle's horn or bell sounding (audible; a source without audio declares it absent, and no visible state stands in for it) **Not a stand-in for:** a siren | general |
| `sig.hand_signal` | a driver's or rider's arm signal; **meaning** ∈ {no_signal, left, right, stop_or_slow, re_enter}: no arm signal given, or the meaning of the one given | general |
| `sig.door_open` | a door open; **side** ∈ {traffic, curb} | general |

## 6. Environment (`env`)

| id | contract | scope |
|---|---|---|
| `env.darkness` | insufficient natural light; the boundary relative to sunset and sunrise is a reading parameter | general |
| `env.precipitation` | rain or snow falling | general |
| `env.wet_road` | road surface wet, standing water | general |
| `env.ice_or_snow` | road surface icy or snow-covered | general |
| `env.visibility` | visibility distance (fog, dust, smoke) | general |
| `env.civil_time` | the local calendar time of the observation: date, weekday, time of day (from the recording's metadata, not from the scene) **Not a stand-in for:** `kin.time`, which orders observations within a trace and carries no date | general |

Weather and surface conditions are what a speed or care standard is judged against; every one of
them is observable and is kept whether or not a single clause names it. Civil time is what a
posted hours-of-effect condition is judged against; a source that records no calendar time
declares it absent, and every specification that reads it then reports unknown.

## 7. Relations between road users (`rel`)

| id | contract | scope |
|---|---|---|
| `rel.centre_distance` | Euclidean ground-plane distance between reference points **Not a stand-in for:** a clearance between bodies or an order of arrival — centre-to-centre overstates a clearance by about the two half-extents, and proximity says nothing about who reached a boundary first | general |
| `rel.surface_gap` | distance between the nearest points of two bodies; longitudinal and lateral components in the subject's frame | general |
| `rel.ahead_behind_in_lane` | a is ahead of / behind b in the same lane, along the lane direction | general |
| `rel.longitudinal_overlap` | the bodies overlap along the lane axis (side by side); signed overlap length | general |
| `rel.oncoming` | headings opposed and closing: the cosine of the angle between the headings is below the negative of its tolerance, which is the cosine of the largest angle off exactly opposed allowed, a ratio between -1 and 1 | general |
| `rel.same_direction` | headings aligned: the cosine of the angle between the headings is above its tolerance, which is the cosine of the largest angle allowed, a ratio between -1 and 1 | general |
| `rel.bearing` | direction of b from a in a's frame (for "on the right of", "immediately to the rear") | general |
| `rel.contact` | the bodies of two road users, or a road user and a structure, touch or overlap (a collision) **Not a stand-in for:** a near miss — that is `drv.time_to_conflict` | general |
| `rel.visible` | b is visible from a: an unobstructed line of sight from a's reference point to b's body, as the source tests it (a ray cast, an occlusion test, an annotator's judgement) **Not a stand-in for:** a distance, the sight distance of a place (`st.sight_distance`) — what could be seen from or at a place, whether or not any road user is there, is that atom, the clarity of the air (`env.visibility`), or a lamp being lit — a visible vehicle may show no lamp and a lit lamp may be hidden | general |

Computed from kinematics; listed because traffic language names them directly and a source may
supply them measured rather than derived. `rel.visible` is the exception: it depends on what
stands between two bodies, which no kinematics carry, so only a source supplies it and it is
never computed.

## 8. Judgement standards — not atoms; how a rule gives them a concrete meaning

Traffic law states many duties as standards: a manoeuvre made "with safety", a speed that is
"reasonable", a distance that is "practicable", a vehicle "so close as to be a hazard", a stop
"when necessary". No scene contains a reasonableness. A specification that bottoms out in such a
word detects nothing, so a standard is never an atom and never a leaf of a rule.

**Operationalization.** The plan bounds every standard in a clause by concepts and primitives
with parameters the reading sets, and records an *operationalization claim*: the standard's
words, the concepts, the parameters, and the engineering convention their values come from (a
headway convention, a gap-acceptance convention, a stopping-distance model, a sight-distance
model). The
harness rejects a node that maps a standard to nothing; the review phase checks that the claim
bounds the standard rather than replacing an observable the clause states outright. The same
claim is what a label uses, so specification and label quantify the standard exactly once.

**Two kinds of rule follow.** Where the standard qualifies an otherwise concrete duty (a yield
that is owed when the other vehicle is "so close as to be a hazard"), the operationalization is a
bound on one element and the rule is the law's own rule. Where the standard *is* the duty ("due
care", "careless", "reasonable speed"), any operationalization is a policy choice, not a reading
of the text: such a rule is marked **surrogate**, its verdicts are evidence and not a legal
conclusion, and it is evaluated separately.

**One kind of standard has only a surrogate.** A standard about the driver's state of mind —
care, attention, intent, knowledge — is not observable (§9): any operationalization of it is a
surrogate, whatever concepts bound it.

## 9. Not atoms

**Legal region classes** — categories a jurisdiction defines administratively and that are not
visible on the road: a district defined by its buildings, an urban or rural area, a city or town
limit, a mountain or canyon highway, premises to which the public has access, the designation of a
highway as a priority road, whether school is in session and its hours, the hours a signed
restriction is in effect when the sign only refers to them. These enter a formalization only as
**reading assumptions** declared per map or per trace, never as atoms a rule reads from a scene.
Where the same category is *also* marked on the road by a sign (`dev.zone_sign`), the sign is the
atom and the category is not.

**Purpose, perception and intention** — why a vehicle is stopped (loading, waiting for a
pedestrian, receiving passengers), what a driver perceived, knew, ascertained or intended. These
are not observable, and a rule is a check of conduct on a trace, so a span that turns on one is
read through the conduct or the outcome it governs: an intention by the act it leads to (an
intention to turn by the turn the road user makes within a window ahead, or by the signal given
for it), a duty to perceive, ascertain or make sure by the outcome the check is there to secure
(the movement made with the clearances the reading sets), a purpose by the conduct it explains.
Who or what controls a vehicle — a person at the controls, an automated driving system, no one —
is not observable either: "drives", "operates" and "the driver" are read through the vehicle's
controlled motion, a vehicle moving on the road is taken to be driven, and the duty binds that
vehicle's conduct whoever or whatever controls it. Where the words offer observable evidence themselves, the rule reads that evidence (what was in an
actual road user's line of sight is `rel.visible`; what could be seen from or at a place is
`st.sight_distance`). Each such reading is disclosed on its span as a narrowing of kind
`observable_reading` with its category (`intention`, `perception`, `status`, `purpose`, `agency`): it is a
reading of the words, not an approximation by a neighbouring atom, and never an assumption or a
gap. A state of mind that shows in no conduct is outside what a trace can check, and a rule never
assumes one. The control state of
a vehicle — engine running, parking brake set, gear, throttle, service brake — is not of this
kind: it is observed on an instrumented vehicle and carried by the control-state atoms of §2,
under the `subject` capability where only the subject's vehicle is instrumented.

**Legal status of a feature on the road** — that a sign, a signal, a marking, an opening or a
crossing is official, posted or designated by an authority. The feature's presence on the road is
the observable evidence of that status: a rule reads the feature and presumes the status (an
`observable_reading` of category `status`). A category that no feature on the road displays is a
legal region class (above).

**Lawfulness of another road user's conduct** ("pedestrians lawfully within the crosswalk", "a
person lawfully riding") — a reference to another rule's verdict, expressed by rule composition in
Core, not by an atom.

**Concepts** (`drv`) — manoeuvres, states of motion, road configurations and relations between
road users over time (a stop, a turn, a pass, a following gap, a laned roadway) are not atoms.
They are concept nodes the pipeline defines over atoms, primitives and other concepts, each with a
contract of its own, accepted like a rule and called by id (`drv.<family>.<name>`); a rule never
rebuilds one inline.

**Dataset fields** — any edge label, trigger region, render distance, band label or node name of
a particular scene-graph format. These are how a source grounds an atom; they belong in the
adapter and its manifest, never in a rule.

## 10. Primitives (`prim`) — computations the formula language cannot express

A primitive is a geometric computation over atoms with no legal word in it, defined once in Core
with its parameters exposed. A concept or a rule calls it by id; the set is closed, and a need
for another is a gap for the operator, never a definition written during a run.

| id | contract | parameters | result unit | parameter units |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `prim.heading_change` | the signed heading change (degrees, left positive) of a road user over the window behind the observation, integrated from `kin.yaw_rate`; unknown where the window is truncated, sampled too sparsely, or a yaw rate is missing | the window length (time) | deg | s |
| `prim.closest_approach_within` | under constant velocities, the centres of two road users approach each other at some time between the observation and the horizon | the horizon (time) | boolean | s |
| `prim.closest_approach_time` | the time from the observation at which the two centres are closest, under constant velocities; undefined when they do not approach within the horizon | the horizon (time) | s | s |
| `prim.closest_approach_distance` | the centre distance at that closest approach; undefined when they do not approach within the horizon | the horizon (time) | m | s |
| `prim.conditions_hold` | the structured conditions of a device (`dev.zone_sign`, `dev.regulatory_sign`) hold at the observation for a road user: `env.civil_time` falls in one of its time windows on one of its days (a calendar class is an assumption), and any occupancy or class condition is met | — | boolean | — |
| `prim.region_lateral_offset` | the signed lateral offset (m, left positive) of a structure region from a road user: the component, perpendicular to the road user's heading, of the vector from its reference point to the point of the region's boundary nearest that reference point; zero where the reference point lies inside the region; unknown where the position, the heading or the boundary is absent | — | m | — |

## 11. Units of the measured atoms

The unit of the value a formula reads from a measured atom, by the name a formula uses
(`Term.measure`); a vector atom's components share its unit. `1` marks a count, a ratio, a
direction or an ordinal, which carry no unit; `1/m` is a reciprocal length. A primitive's units are
the last two columns of §10. These units type a comparison: two sides of a comparison, of a sum
or of the branches of a selection have the same unit.
