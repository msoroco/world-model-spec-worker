# Traffic-law ontology — atoms

Status: frozen. Changed only by an explicit ontology change, never by a rule and never by an
agent.

## What an atom is

An **atom** is an element of the road world that traffic law refers to without defining it
further and that a data source can observe: a class of road user, a quantity of motion, a piece
of road structure, a control device and its state, a signal a road user emits, a condition of the
environment, or a relation between two road users. Each atom has a **semantic contract** — what
it denotes physically, its unit and its reference frame, and, where the meaning invites
confusion, what it is **not a stand-in for**. The contract is independent of any data source and
of any statute.

A standard of judgement ("safe", "reasonable", "practicable") is **not** an atom: nothing in a
scene is a reasonableness. §8 says how a rule gives such a standard a concrete meaning.

## The termination rule

This file is the whole termination rule. It has six clauses; the harness and the review phase
enforce them, and nothing else adds to or bypasses them.

1. **Closed set.** A rule reads the world only through the atoms of §1–§7, the primitives of
   §10, and the concepts the pipeline has accepted (§9). An element a clause needs that none of
   these carries is an ontology change request, filed as a gap; it is never approximated by
   another atom, and it is never absorbed as a residue on a span that decides when the rule
   applies. A residue records only what the obligation side says and the rule does not capture.
2. **Contract-bound.** An atom expresses only what its contract says. The "not a stand-in for"
   clauses are part of the contract; using an atom for what its contract excludes is a semantic
   error, whatever the data source happens to make convenient.
3. **Defined once.** A concept — a manoeuvre, a state of motion, a road configuration — is a
   node of the pipeline: a contract and a body over atoms, primitives and other concepts, accepted
   like a rule, called by id and never rebuilt inline. A primitive (§10) is a computation the
   formula language cannot express, defined once in Core with its parameters exposed. A rule
   instantiates parameters; it never redefines either.
4. **A judgement standard is operationalized, never read.** A clause element that is a standard
   of judgement is bounded, in the plan, by concepts and primitives with parameters the reading
   sets, and the bound is recorded as an *operationalization claim* that names the standard,
   the concepts, the parameters and the convention their values come from. A rule that leaves a
   standard unoperationalized is not a rule; a rule whose only content is an operationalized
   standard is a **surrogate** and is marked as one.
5. **Legal region classes are assumptions.** Categories a jurisdiction defines administratively
   (a district, an area class, a calendar or clock condition, a legal designation of a highway)
   enter a formalization only as reading assumptions declared per map or per trace, never as
   atoms a rule reads from a scene.
6. **Unobserved is unknown.** Every atom is three-valued when observed — true, false, or *not
   observed on this source* — as declared by that source's capability manifest. A rule built on
   an unobserved atom reports `unknown`, never compliance and never violation.

**How atoms are reached from a clause.** Mapping the elements of a clause onto atoms is the
planning session's work — the linguistic half of autoformalization. Each planned node records
its mappings as *grounding claims* (`elements`: clause element → atoms, with a justification that
cites the contracts) and its *operationalization claims* (§8). The harness validates them before
any rule is written: every atom named exists here; the same element maps to the same atoms in
every node of the run, so a contradiction is rejected; and the run's mapping index, which the
harness derives from the accepted nodes, is what the review phase and its calibration read. No
agent writes a shared file, and nothing about a corpus is decided before the run that formalizes
it.

This file says nothing about which law refers to which atom and nothing about how any data
source produces one. Which atoms a source can observe is declared at run time by that source's
**capability manifest**, one capability per atom: `exact`, `estimate` (with a named error
class), `absent`, or `subject` — observed for the subject track only, as an instrumented vehicle
or a simulator reports its own controls and its own line of sight and nobody else's. Under
`subject` a read of the atom for any other road user is unknown.

**Scope column.** `general` marks an element of the ordinary road vocabulary. `local` marks an
element that exists because the target jurisdiction's own vehicle taxonomy or device catalogue
names it; its contract still describes what is physically observed, and a source that has no such
thing declares it `absent`. The flag is information for the manifest author and the reviewer, not
a permission: local atoms are atoms.

Identifier scheme: `family.name`. Families: `ru` road user, `kin` kinematics, `st` road
structure, `dev` control device, `sig` emitted signal, `env` environment, `rel` relation between
road users. Derived concepts use `drv`. Where an atom carries an attribute (a state, a kind, a
colour), the attribute's values are listed in the contract; an attribute value not listed is an
ontology change request.

## 1. Road users (`ru`) — class atoms on an entity

| id | contract | scope |
|---|---|---|
| `ru.motor_vehicle` | a self-propelled vehicle other than a rail vehicle; excludes the powered two-wheelers a jurisdiction classes separately below **Not a stand-in for:** "vehicle" as a legal aggregate — which classes count as a vehicle is declared by the reading | general |
| `ru.motorcycle` | motor vehicle on two or three wheels ridden astride, including three-wheeled variants | general |
| `ru.moped` | a low-power two- or three-wheeler with a small engine or motor, as a jurisdiction classes it | general |
| `ru.bus` | motor vehicle designed to carry many passengers | general |
| `ru.transit_bus` | bus in public transit service, identifiable by its livery or route display | general |
| `ru.school_bus` | bus designated for carrying school children, with the jurisdiction's markings | general |
| `ru.taxicab` | passenger vehicle for hire, identifiable by its markings | general |
| `ru.tour_bus_or_limousine` | a tour or shuttle bus, or a lengthened passenger vehicle for hire, identifiable by its livery | local |
| `ru.truck` | motor vehicle for carrying goods, with a body built for that purpose | general |
| `ru.commercial_motor_vehicle` | vehicle over the jurisdiction's commercial mass class or marked as commercially licensed | general |
| `ru.trailer_or_combination` | vehicle drawn by another, or the combination | general |
| `ru.bicycle` | human-powered wheeled vehicle ridden by a person | general |
| `ru.electric_bicycle` | a bicycle with an assisting electric motor; **class** attribute as the jurisdiction's taxonomy labels it | local |
| `ru.electric_scooter` | a standing or seated electric scooter with handlebars | local |
| `ru.pedestrian` | a person on foot, in a wheelchair, or on a device the jurisdiction treats as on foot **Not a stand-in for:** a person on a bicycle or scooter | general |
| `ru.pedestrian_with_white_cane_or_guide_animal` | pedestrian carrying a white or white-and-red cane, accompanied by a guide animal, or led by another person | general |
| `ru.child` | pedestrian who is visibly a child | general |
| `ru.emergency_vehicle` | vehicle of a class the jurisdiction designates as emergency; **kind** ∈ {police, fire, ambulance, other} **Not a stand-in for:** a responding emergency vehicle — the class alone is not responding; its responding is conduct, carried by a concept, and an unobserved lamp or siren makes the rule unknown, not satisfied | general |
| `ru.fire_apparatus` | a fire-fighting vehicle (a sub-kind of `ru.emergency_vehicle` that law names on its own) | general |
| `ru.official_vehicle` | a vehicle in official or contracted road service, identifiable by livery or equipment; **kind** ∈ {tow, utility, highway_maintenance, incident_management, regulatory_agency, coroner, armored_car, municipal, other} **Not a stand-in for:** an emergency vehicle | general (kinds `incident_management`, `regulatory_agency`, `armored_car`: local) |
| `ru.rail_vehicle` | a train, tram, streetcar or other on-track equipment | general |
| `ru.occupant_count` | the number of persons in or on a vehicle (an integer attribute of a road user). A source that observes a change in it — a person arriving at or leaving a vehicle — but not a total, declares the count absent: what it observes then is the arrival or the departure, which is not this atom | general |
| `ru.rider_posture` | how a rider sits and holds the machine: **on_seat**, **hands_on_controls** (count), **standing_on_deck**, **holding_another_vehicle**, **stunt** (a wheel off the ground, a person on the handlebars). The fields are independent: a source declares each on its own, and one that renders a rider as part of the machine, so that no field can vary, declares all of them absent. **hands_on_controls** is a count and is the field a source is least likely to carry **Not a stand-in for:** a manoeuvre, or an arm signal, which is `sig.hand_signal` | general |
| `ru.subject` | the road user whose conduct a rule judges (the ego) | general |
| `ru.aggregate` | membership of a legal aggregate: the atom's literal argument is an aggregate id, `<definition id>::<term>` for the posted definition that applies, or `<law id>:<span>::<term>` for a definition the law itself makes, and the run's reading classifies every road-user class under that id by the definition's words as included, excluded (the definition leaves it out), covered (the definition admits its members only as members of named included classes, which a road user carries beside it, so its own label adds no membership evidence) or unresolved; true when the user carries an included class, unknown when no included class holds and the user carries an unresolved class or an included or unresolved class it might carry is unobserved, false otherwise: a covered or excluded class decides nothing **Not a stand-in for:** a named road-user class for which the applicable definitions and the run's representation decisions permit its own class atom — that class's own atom; an admitted aggregate stays an aggregate even when it contains only one class; a relational role such as who drives or controls a vehicle — never membership; nor a role the text describes by conduct (responding, overtaking) — a role is a derived concept | general |

Legal aggregate words ("vehicle", "traffic") are carried by `ru.aggregate` with the definition-scoped
id as its argument, never the word: which classes the posted definition counts under that id is
derived from its words and recorded in the reading, never expanded into a class list by a rule.
"Driver" is no aggregate: it names who controls a vehicle, a relational role read as the section on
what is not an atom states. A responding emergency vehicle is a role the words describe by conduct, carried by a concept, not by the class.

## 2. Kinematics and control state (`kin`) — measurements on any road user, and the inputs to a vehicle's controls

| id | contract | unit / frame | scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kin.time` | instant of observation of a scene | ms, monotone within a trace | general |
| `kin.position` | position of the body's reference point | m, world frame (map or local) | general |
| `kin.heading` | direction the body points; a formula reads it normalised: divided by its larger absolute component, then by its length taken to a micrometre, so the vector read is the unit vector times a factor of at least 1 and below 1 + 2·10⁻⁶ (exactly the unit vector where that scaled length is a whole number of micrometres, as for an axis-aligned direction); a zero vector reads unknown | unit vector, world frame | general |
| `kin.velocity` | velocity vector | m/s, world frame | general |
| `kin.speed` | magnitude of velocity | m/s | general |
| `kin.accel_longitudinal` | acceleration along heading, signed **Not a stand-in for:** speed | m/s² | general |
| `kin.yaw_rate` | rate of change of heading, positive when the heading turns to the left (counter-clockwise) **Not a stand-in for:** road curvature — a vehicle yaws on a straight road whenever it manoeuvres | deg/s | general |
| `kin.extent` | the body's size along its axes about the reference point: a trace writes the half-length, half-width and half-height; a formula reads the full length, width and height, twice each | m | general |
| `kin.steer_angle` | front-wheel steering angle. A source often carries it for the road user whose conduct is judged and not for the others; the capability is declared for the atom, not per road user, so a source that supplies it for the subject alone declares `subject` and one that cannot supply it at all declares it absent **Not a stand-in for:** road geometry, a turn, a lane change or any other manoeuvre — a steering input is not a path and not a road | deg | general |
| `kin.path_length` | distance travelled along the body's path since the start of the trace, monotone | m | general |
| `kin.engine_running` | the vehicle's engine or motor is running, so that propulsion is available **Not a stand-in for:** motion or a halt — a vehicle stands with its engine running and rolls with it stopped | — | general |
| `kin.parking_brake` | the parking brake (hand brake) is set **Not a stand-in for:** the service brake (`kin.service_brake`) or the brake lamp (`sig.brake_lamp`) — a set parking brake lights no lamp and a pressed pedal sets no parking brake | — | general |
| `kin.gear` | the gear selected: negative for reverse, zero for neutral, positive for a forward gear **Not a stand-in for:** the direction of motion — a vehicle in a forward gear rolls backwards on a grade; backing is read from kinematics | gear number, signed | general |
| `kin.throttle` | the accelerator input, as the fraction of its full travel that is applied **Not a stand-in for:** acceleration (`kin.accel_longitudinal`) — the input is what the driver does, the acceleration is what the body does | ratio | general |
| `kin.service_brake` | the service brake (foot brake) input, as the fraction of its full travel that is applied **Not a stand-in for:** deceleration or the brake lamp — the lamp is what other road users see, the input is what the driver does | ratio | general |

The control-state atoms are observed on an instrumented vehicle — a simulator's own vehicle, a
vehicle with a data recorder. A source that observes them on the subject's vehicle alone declares
them `subject`; a source that observes none declares them absent, and a rule that reads one then
reports unknown.

## 3. Road structure (`st`) — map-level atoms and occupancy

A kind whose contract ends in **Refines:** names the kind it refines: every region of the refining kind is also a region of the kind it refines, and of every kind that one refines. A parent never implies a refining kind, and two kinds refining one parent never imply each other. Refinement is not lying on a way (`st.on_way`): a region that lies on another is not thereby of its kind. Where a source cannot tell a refining kind, only the regions it labels with a kind that refining kind refines are unknown members of it; a region of any other kind is known not to be one. A kind whose contract begins with **Abstract.** is the union of the kinds that refine it, and only a quantifier or a formula reads it: no region is labelled with it, no source declares it a kind it cannot tell, it refines no kind, and a region is of it exactly when it is of a kind that refines it (unknown where that is unknown for one of them and true for none). An abstract parent is no parent for what a source cannot tell: a kind whose parent is abstract is treated, where a source cannot tell it, as a kind that refines none.

| id | contract | scope |
|---|---|---|
| `st.highway` | the entire public way between its boundary lines, including sidewalks and shoulders **Not a stand-in for:** the roadway | general |
| `st.travel_region` | **Abstract.** the union of the kinds a device can govern (`dev.governs`): a lane and the kinds that refine it, a bicycle lane or path, a roadway and the kinds that refine it, a shoulder, or an intersection; a region is a travel region exactly when it is of one of them **Not a stand-in for:** the extent of a highway (`st.highway`, `st.on_way`) — a sidewalk, a crosswalk, a stop line or the way as a whole is no travel region; travel along or across a way, which the road user's motion and the region's direction state, never the kind of the region occupied; or which entry into an intersection a region is (`st.lane_enters`, `st.entrance_of`) | general |
| `st.roadway` | the part of a highway improved for vehicular traffic, excluding shoulder; separate roadways of a divided highway are separate **Not a stand-in for:** the sidewalk — 'not on the roadway' includes shoulder, verge and parking bays **Refines:** `st.travel_region` | general |
| `st.lane` | a longitudinal strip of roadway for one line of vehicles **Not a stand-in for:** a half of the roadway or a lateral position within a lane — lane membership is not an offset from the edge, and lane ordinal equals roadway half only on a two-lane road **Refines:** `st.travel_region` | general |
| `st.lane_direction` | direction of travel designated for a structure a vehicle travels in — a lane, reserved lane, turn lane, bicycle lane or path, or a roadway, one-way roadway or shoulder; a centre turn lane carries none. The direction is local to its carrier (a bend or a loop is written as segments), carriers that overlap or cross may carry different directions, and a place no carrier covers has none (unknown). It is written at any length; a formula reads it normalised: divided by its larger absolute component, then by its length taken to a micrometre, so the vector read is the unit vector times a factor of at least 1 and below 1 + 2·10⁻⁶ (exactly the unit vector where that scaled length is a whole number of micrometres, as for an axis-aligned direction); a zero vector reads unknown | general |
| `st.lane_adjacency` | left / right neighbouring lane of the same direction; lane ordinal within the carriageway and the count of lanes in that direction; ordinal 1 is the leftmost lane, looking along the lane's direction **Not a stand-in for:** the marking between two lanes | general |
| `st.lane_connectivity` | which lane a lane leads into | general |
| `st.lane_enters` | relation: the intersection region a directed approach carrier runs into at its entrance end — the carrier is an approach to that intersection. A carrier is a lane or a kind refining it, or a roadway, one-way roadway, shoulder or bicycle lane or path that the source records as a directed approach segment: the stretch one direction of travel uses to reach one junction, its entrance end at that junction. A bicycle lane or path stays its own kind, not a lane, and a mark or a device's governance on it does not pass to an adjacent lane, nor theirs to it. A two-way road between two junctions is written, where the source can separate its directions, as one segment per direction, each entering the junction its direction reaches; each keeps its kind, and none is relabelled one-way for having a direction, nor is a lane written where the road has none. Writing the relation on a roadway, one-way roadway, shoulder or bicycle lane or path asserts that it is such a segment: a whole two-way roadway or bicycle path, with an end at each junction, carries none, and which junction it is an approach to stays unknown. A carrier enters one intersection at most. The relation is entry topology: it is decided where the source records it, whether or not the carrier's direction (`st.lane_direction`) is observed. It is the source's record, never inferred from distance, overlap or a road user's velocity, and a carrier never takes the entrance of a carrier it overlaps. **Which carrier a road user approaches through:** a road user's approach to an intersection is a carrier it occupies (`rel.occupies`) whose entrance end is that intersection, and the mark that governs that approach is one the source records as marking that carrier (`st.entrance_of`). The intersection is fixed by the event the rule reads (the intersection entered, or the one the words name), never by the road user's velocity or heading, by distance or by overlap. A road user occupying one such carrier approaches through it whatever its motion: forward, at rest, backing, or with its velocity or heading unobserved. Overlapping carriers that enter different intersections are told apart by the intersection, not by motion. Where it occupies several carriers entering the same intersection and the verdict differs between them (different marks, or one mark's association unobserved), which governs is unknown; where the verdict is the same through each, it is decided; a rule never picks the carrier that favours the road user. Travel against a carrier's direction does not change which intersection the carrier enters, and reaching a carrier's far (exit) end is no entry through it **Not a stand-in for:** the lane a lane leads into (`st.lane_connectivity`), the subject's presence in the intersection (`rel.occupies`), or the region a device governs (`dev.governs`) — a device governs a lane and the lane enters an intersection; which intersection a device controls is read through both, or directly where the device governs the intersection | general |
| `st.on_way` | relation: the public way (a `highway` region) a structure region lies on — a lane, roadway, shoulder, crosswalk, stop line, median or any other part of it; an intersection lies on every way that meets there **Not a stand-in for:** nearness to a way (`st.region_geometry`), or the lane a lane leads into (`st.lane_connectivity`) | general |
| `st.entrance_of` | relation: the carrier whose entrance into an intersection a stop line or a crosswalk marks — exactly that carrier's entrance, the line or crossing a vehicle approaching through that carrier halts at or before, and not a line near the carrier or on its way. The carriers are those `st.lane_enters` admits: a lane or a kind refining it, or a roadway, one-way roadway, shoulder or bicycle lane or path recorded as a directed approach segment; the intersection is the one that carrier enters, so a rule reads both relations on the same carrier. One line may mark several carriers (several lanes, or lanes and a segment or a bicycle lane beside them), and a carrier may have a stop line and a crosswalk. Where the source observes a line's entrances its list is complete, and the line marks no carrier it does not list; where it does not, which carriers the line marks is unknown, never "no line for this carrier". The association is the source's record, never inferred from distance, overlap or a road user's velocity; a carrier never takes the line, nor the governance of a device (`dev.governs`), of a carrier it overlaps. No region other than a stop line or a crosswalk marks an entrance **Not a stand-in for:** distance to the line (`st.region_geometry`), or the way the line lies on (`st.on_way`) | general |
| `st.lane_marking` | per side of a lane: **type** ∈ {none, broken, solid, double_solid, solid_broken, dotted, curb}, **colour** ∈ {white, yellow, other} | general |
| `st.centre_line` | the marking, or the geometric centre, dividing the two directions of a two-way roadway | general |
| `st.road_edge` | curb or edge of the roadway; **paved** attribute for the surface beyond it | general |
| `st.shoulder` | the part of the highway beside the roadway not intended for vehicular traffic; **paved** attribute **Refines:** `st.travel_region` | general |
| `st.sidewalk` | area for pedestrians between roadway and property line **Not a stand-in for:** a crosswalk | general |
| `st.median_or_divider` | physical barrier or dividing section between roadways; **opening** attribute where a crossover exists | general |
| `st.one_way_roadway` | roadway on which traffic is restricted to one direction **Refines:** `st.roadway` | general |
| `st.intersection` | the region where two roadways meet, bounded by the prolongation of their edges; a junction where an alley meets another way (a street, road, highway or alley) is no intersection but a `st.driveway_or_alley_entrance` **Not a stand-in for:** a crosswalk or a stop line — a stop before the crossing is earlier than a stop before the intersection **Refines:** `st.travel_region` | general |
| `st.crosswalk` | marked crossing, or the unmarked prolongation of sidewalks at an intersection (`st.intersection`); **marked** attribute | general |
| `st.stop_line` | the transverse line marking where vehicles halt for a device | general |
| `st.driveway_or_alley_entrance` | private road, alley or driveway meeting the highway **Not a stand-in for:** which of them meets the highway there — the kind does not tell an alley's entrance from a private road's or driveway's | general |
| `st.alley` | a narrow way within a block serving the rear of properties | general |
| `st.curvature` | horizontal curvature of the roadway at a point, as a magnitude (1/m, never negative): a bend to either hand has the same value | general |
| `st.grade` | longitudinal slope of the roadway at a point **Not a stand-in for:** the place of a crest (`st.crest`) — the slope where a road user is says nothing of a crest ahead of it | general |
| `st.crest` | the place on a roadway's longitudinal profile where the slope changes from rising to falling in the direction of travel, carried as a region with a reference point and a boundary, so the ground distance from a road user to it is read through `st.region_geometry` **Not a stand-in for:** the slope at a point (`st.grade`), the view a crest restricts (`st.sight_distance`), or a horizontal bend (`st.curvature`) | general |
| `st.sight_distance` | the distance along the road within which a vehicle at a point and another vehicle on the road could see each other, from the eye of either driver to the body of the other vehicle at the height convention the source declares: both the view of approaching traffic from that point and its being seen by drivers approaching it, whether or not any road user is there **Not a stand-in for:** whether an actual road user saw, or could see, another at an observation (`rel.visible`), or the clarity of the air (`env.visibility`) | general |
| `st.sight_along_way` | the distance along a way, in each direction from the point of that way nearest a road user, within which another vehicle on that way could be seen from the road user's eye at the observation, at the height convention the source declares; the smaller of the two directions; m **Not a stand-in for:** the sight distance of the place the road user is at (`st.sight_distance`), or whether an actual road user is seen (`rel.visible`) | general |
| `st.railway_crossing` | level crossing of a railway with the roadway, and its nearest rail | general |
| `st.controlled_access` | a highway with access only at designated points, and its entrance and exit lanes | general |
| `st.elevated_structure` | bridge, viaduct or tunnel carrying the roadway | general |
| `st.bicycle_lane_or_path` | lane or separate path reserved for bicycles and the devices a jurisdiction groups with them **Refines:** `st.travel_region` | general |
| `st.reserved_lane` | lane reserved for a class of vehicles; **class** ∈ {high_occupancy, bus, heavy_vehicle, other} **Refines:** `st.lane` | general (class `high_occupancy` with occupancy and hours conditions: local) |
| `st.centre_turn_lane` | a single centre lane used only for turning by traffic in both directions **Refines:** `st.lane` | local |
| `st.turn_lane` | a lane designated only for turning; **side** ∈ {left, right} **Refines:** `st.lane` | general |
| `st.parking_space` | marked bay for standing or parking; **angle** attribute; **designation** ∈ {general, disabled, disabled_side_lift, access_aisle, municipal, charging} | general |
| `st.curb_zone` | a signed or marked length of curb; **kind** ∈ {passenger_loading, freight_loading, tour_bus_loading, restricted_parking, bus_stop, taxicab_stand, fire_lane, no_stopping, no_parking}; **colour** ∈ {red, yellow, white, blue, gray, none} where the curb itself is painted | general (curb colour code and kind `tour_bus_loading`: local) |
| `st.transit_stop` | a bus stop, bench, shelter or platform for public transport passengers | general |
| `st.safety_zone` | an area within the highway marked off for pedestrians only | general |

| `st.region_geometry` | the reference point and the boundary polygon of a structure region in the world frame, and the ground distance from a road user's body outline to it (zero when they overlap); a source that maps regions without their outline declares it absent, and every such distance is then unknown **Not a stand-in for:** occupancy — a footprint inside a boundary is `rel.occupies`, which a source may observe without geometry | general |
| `st.obstruction` | a physical object on or beside the roadway that is not a road user; **kind** ∈ {debris, excavation, hose, barrier, stalled_vehicle_wreckage, sidewalk_fixture, mail_drop_box, other} | general |
| `rel.occupies` | a road user's footprint overlaps a lane / region (roadway, shoulder, sidewalk, intersection, crosswalk, stop line, safety zone, bicycle lane, median, alley, curb zone, controlled-access lane, structure) | general |

## 4. Control devices (`dev`) — class, state, position, governance

| id | contract | scope |
|---|---|---|
| `dev.traffic_signal` | a signal head; **state** ∈ {circular_green, circular_yellow, circular_red, green_arrow(dir), yellow_arrow(dir), red_arrow(dir), flashing_yellow_arrow(dir), flashing_red, flashing_yellow, dark, unknown} with dir ∈ {left, right, straight, u_turn}; several states may be displayed at once; **uncovered** attribute for an installed head whose faces are not covered | general (state `flashing_yellow_arrow`: local) |
| `dev.pedestrian_signal` | a pedestrian head; **state** ∈ {walk, dont_walk_flashing, dont_walk_steady, dark}; **countdown** attribute when a timer is displayed | general (countdown semantics: local) |
| `dev.lane_control_signal` | an overhead per-lane signal; **state** ∈ {green_down_arrow, red_x, yellow_x, yellow_arrow(dir), dark} | local |
| `dev.speed_limit_beacon` | a pair or more of yellow lamps mounted with a speed sign, flashing alternately when the sign's limit is in effect; **flashing** attribute | local |
| `dev.crossing_warning_signal` | a signal device at a pedestrian or school crossing that warns of persons crossing; **active** attribute | general |
| `dev.stop_sign` | regulatory sign requiring a full halt | general |
| `dev.yield_sign` | regulatory sign requiring yielding without a mandatory halt | general |
| `dev.speed_limit_sign` | sign stating a maximum or minimum speed, with value and unit; **kind** ∈ {maximum, minimum, structure_maximum, zone} | general |
| `dev.regulatory_sign` | a point regulation by catalogue **code**, with the same structured **conditions** attribute as `dev.zone_sign`, read as that row says (unconditional when empty, unknown when absent), where the sign states hours, days, a duration or a class: no_left_turn, no_right_turn, no_u_turn, no_straight, one_way, keep_right, do_not_enter, wrong_way, no_stopping, no_standing, no_parking, angle_parking, lane_use_arrow, turn_course_marker, right_turn_only, entrance, exit, closed_to_traffic, exempt_crossing, abandoned_crossing, shoulder_use_permitted, bicycles_prohibited, pedestrians_prohibited, nonmotorized_prohibited, motor_vehicles_prohibited, truck_route, no_trucks **Not a stand-in for:** a manoeuvre or a road feature — a prohibition sign is a condition, a warning sign is not the hazard it warns of, and a sign is not a signal | general (`shoulder_use_permitted`, `exempt_crossing`, `truck_route`: local) |
| `dev.zone_sign` | a sign that begins or ends a signed zone along the road; **kind** ∈ {school, school_crossing, pedestrian_safety, temporary_traffic_control, no_passing, high_occupancy_lane, heavy_vehicle_lane, speed_zone, narrow_highway, hazardous_place, parking_restricted, trail}; **end** attribute; **conditions** attribute: a structured reading of the sign's legend — a list of time windows (a set of weekdays or a calendar class such as school days, a start and an end time of day), a minimum occupancy, a duration limit, a vehicle class, or a "when children present" flag; a legend read with no restriction is the empty set (unconditional), a legend not read is absent (every condition unknown) **Not a stand-in for:** whether the condition holds now — that is `prim.conditions_hold` | general (kinds `school_crossing`, `pedestrian_safety`, `high_occupancy_lane`: local) |
| `dev.railway_signal_or_gate` | the devices at a level crossing; **lights** ∈ {flashing, dark}; **gate** ∈ {up, lowering, down, raising, none}; **bell** attribute | general |
| `dev.temporary_traffic_control` | cones, barricades, temporary signs and flashers marking works, a closure or an obstruction | general |
| `dev.human_direction` | a person directing traffic and the direction given; **role** ∈ {police_officer, flagger, school_crossing_guard, railroad_flagger}; **indication** ∈ {stop, proceed, slow, turn(dir)} | general |
| `dev.school_bus_signal` | the school bus's own devices; **red_flashing**, **amber_flashing**, **stop_arm** attributes | general |
| `dev.governs` | relation: the travel regions whose traffic the device controls — a lane, reserved lane, turn lane, centre turn lane, bicycle lane or path, roadway, one-way roadway or shoulder — or an intersection, read as control of the junction itself and of nothing else (no closure to the lanes that enter it); never a highway, a controlled-access region or a region no vehicle travels in. Unknown where the source does not observe what a device governs **Not a stand-in for:** a position — the region a device governs is not where a halt is required | general |
| `dev.position` | location of the device head / sign face **Not a stand-in for:** a stop line or a crossing — the distance to a signal head is a different quantity from the distance to the line or region | general |
| `dev.inoperative` | a signal head installed and uncovered but showing no valid indication | general |

## 5. Signals emitted by road users (`sig`)

| id | contract | scope |
|---|---|---|
| `sig.turn_indicator` | the turn indicator **state** ∈ {off, left, right}: neither indicator lit, or the left or the right one **Not a stand-in for:** the turn or lane change itself — the indicator is the signal that precedes a manoeuvre, judged separately from it | general |
| `sig.brake_lamp` | brake lamps lit **Not a stand-in for:** a halt or a deceleration — a lamp is an actuation; the motion state is `kin.velocity` / `kin.accel_longitudinal` | general |
| `sig.hazard` | both indicators flashing together | general |
| `sig.headlamp` | headlamp **state** ∈ {off, low_beam, high_beam} | general |
| `sig.position_lamp` | position, parking, cowl or tail lamps lit (the lamps a vehicle shows without its headlamps) | general |
| `sig.compression_brake` | an engine compression brake sounding (audible; a source without audio declares it absent) | general |
| `sig.reverse_lamp` | reversing lamps lit | general |
| `sig.warning_lamp` | a warning lamp lit; **colour** ∈ {red, blue, amber, white}, **mode** ∈ {flashing, rotating, steady}, **facing** ∈ {front, rear, side} **Not a stand-in for:** an audible warning | general (steady blue rear lamps and amber-lamp roles: local) |
| `sig.siren` | a siren, whistle or bell sounding (audible; a source without audio declares it absent, and does not read a warning lamp as the sound — the two are separable and a road user may show one without the other) | general |
| `sig.horn` | an ordinary horn or a rail vehicle's horn or bell sounding (audible; a source without audio declares it absent, and no visible state stands in for it) **Not a stand-in for:** a siren | general |
| `sig.hand_signal` | a driver's or rider's arm signal; **meaning** ∈ {no_signal, left, right, stop_or_slow, re_enter}: no arm signal given, or the meaning of the one given | general |
| `sig.door_open` | a door open; **side** ∈ {traffic, curb} | general |

## 6. Environment (`env`)

| id | contract | scope |
|---|---|---|
| `env.darkness` | insufficient natural light; the boundary relative to sunset and sunrise is a reading parameter | general |
| `env.precipitation` | rain or snow falling | general |
| `env.wet_road` | road surface wet, standing water | general |
| `env.ice_or_snow` | road surface icy or snow-covered | general |
| `env.visibility` | visibility distance (fog, dust, smoke) | general |
| `env.civil_time` | the local calendar time of the observation: date, weekday, time of day (from the recording's metadata, not from the scene) **Not a stand-in for:** `kin.time`, which orders observations within a trace and carries no date | general |

Weather and surface conditions are what a speed or care standard is judged against; every one of
them is observable and is kept whether or not a single clause names it. Civil time is what a
posted hours-of-effect condition is judged against; a source that records no calendar time
declares it absent, and every specification that reads it then reports unknown.

## 7. Relations between road users (`rel`)

| id | contract | scope |
|---|---|---|
| `rel.centre_distance` | Euclidean ground-plane distance between reference points **Not a stand-in for:** a clearance between bodies or an order of arrival — centre-to-centre overstates a clearance by about the two half-extents, and proximity says nothing about who reached a boundary first | general |
| `rel.surface_gap` | distance between the nearest points of two bodies, each body's footprint read with its own heading and extent: zero when they touch or overlap, never negative; its longitudinal and lateral components are the lengths of the vector between those nearest points along and across the subject's heading, and a read without a component is the distance; a supplied gap with a negative component reads unknown, never as its magnitude, as zero or as contact | general |
| `rel.ahead_behind_in_lane` | a is ahead of / behind b in the same lane, along the lane direction | general |
| `rel.longitudinal_overlap` | the bodies overlap along the subject's heading (side by side): the length the two footprints' projections on that axis share, negative for the gap between the projections; a projection, so neither a contact nor a distance between the bodies | general |
| `rel.oncoming` | headings opposed and closing: the cosine of the angle between the headings is below the negative of its tolerance, which is the cosine of the largest angle off exactly opposed allowed, a ratio between -1 and 1 **Not a stand-in for:** the direction a road user approaches from — that is read through the carrier it approaches through, any carrier `st.lane_enters` admits (a lane or a kind refining it, or a roadway, one-way roadway, shoulder or bicycle lane or path recorded as a directed approach segment), whose entrance end is the intersection, and through that carrier's direction (`st.lane_direction`) at the same instant; where that evidence is unobserved, the direction is unknown, never a reason a duty does not arise. A turn can make the current headings cease to satisfy this relation while the vehicle's approach direction remains unchanged. | general |
| `rel.same_direction` | headings aligned: the cosine of the angle between the headings is above its tolerance, which is the cosine of the largest angle allowed, a ratio between -1 and 1 | general |
| `rel.bearing` | direction of b from a in a's frame (for "on the right of", "immediately to the rear") | general |
| `rel.contact` | the bodies of two road users, or a road user and a structure, touch or overlap (a collision) **Not a stand-in for:** a near miss — that is `drv.time_to_conflict` | general |
| `rel.visible` | b is visible from a: an unobstructed line of sight from a's reference point to b's body, as the source tests it (a ray cast, an occlusion test, an annotator's judgement) **Not a stand-in for:** a distance, the sight distance of a place (`st.sight_distance`) — what could be seen from or at a place, whether or not any road user is there, is that atom, the clarity of the air (`env.visibility`), or a lamp being lit — a visible vehicle may show no lamp and a lit lamp may be hidden | general |

Computed from kinematics; listed because traffic language names them directly and a source may
supply them measured rather than derived. `rel.visible` is the exception: it depends on what
stands between two bodies, which no kinematics carry, so only a source supplies it and it is
never computed.

## 8. Judgement standards — not atoms; how a rule gives them a concrete meaning

Traffic law states many duties as standards: a manoeuvre made "with safety", a speed that is
"reasonable", a distance that is "practicable", a vehicle "so close as to be a hazard", a stop
"when necessary". No scene contains a reasonableness. A specification that bottoms out in such a
word detects nothing, so a standard is never an atom and never a leaf of a rule.

**Operationalization.** The plan bounds every standard in a clause by concepts and primitives
with parameters the reading sets, and records an *operationalization claim*: the standard's
words, the concepts, the parameters, and the engineering convention their values come from (a
headway convention, a gap-acceptance convention, a stopping-distance model, a sight-distance
model). The
harness rejects a node that maps a standard to nothing; the review phase checks that the claim
bounds the standard rather than replacing an observable the clause states outright. The same
claim is what a label uses, so specification and label quantify the standard exactly once.

**Two kinds of rule follow.** Where the standard qualifies an otherwise concrete duty (a yield
that is owed when the other vehicle is "so close as to be a hazard"), the operationalization is a
bound on one element and the rule is the law's own rule. Where the standard *is* the duty ("due
care", "careless", "reasonable speed"), any operationalization is a policy choice, not a reading
of the text: such a rule is marked **surrogate**, its verdicts are evidence and not a legal
conclusion, and it is evaluated separately.

**One kind of standard has only a surrogate.** A standard about the driver's state of mind —
care, attention, intent, knowledge — is not observable (§9): any operationalization of it is a
surrogate, whatever concepts bound it. A declared intention (§9) is not of this kind: it is a fact
the trace supplies, not an operationalization of a standard.

## 9. Not atoms

**Legal region classes** — categories a jurisdiction defines administratively and that are not
visible on the road: a district defined by its buildings, an urban or rural area, a city or town
limit, a mountain or canyon highway, premises to which the public has access, the designation of a
highway as a priority road, whether school is in session and its hours, the hours a signed
restriction is in effect when the sign only refers to them. These enter a formalization only as
**reading assumptions** declared per map or per trace, never as atoms a rule reads from a scene.
Where the same category is *also* marked on the road by a sign (`dev.zone_sign`), the sign is the
atom and the category is not.

**Declared intentions** — where the words state that a road user intends, or is preparing, to
turn, the span is carried by a declared intention of that road user at the region the words name:
a fact the trace supplies, under an `int.*` id the plan declares with its meaning, never an act in
a window ahead nor a signal (a signal "of intention" is the signal, `sig.turn_indicator`). The act
the words also name ("is making …") is read by its manoeuvre concept, and the two are joined as the
words join them. What an id covers (an intention to turn, a preparation for a turn) is its
meaning; when it begins and ends is the source's declaration. A declared intention states, at each
scene, the source's declaration current at that scene for one road user at one target region:
- it is **true** where the source's current plan for that road user includes, at that target, what
  the id means;
- it is **false** where the source's current plan decides that what the id means does not hold at
  that target: another manoeuvre, passing through, a manoeuvre cancelled, or one the plan has
  completed;
- an **id is left out** of the record's values wherever the source's plan does not decide its
  meaning, even when other ids of the same pair are listed: what a plan does not mention is
  unknown, never false;
- the **pair is absent** where the source has no current plan for that road user at that target,
  or does not know it.

The value follows the source's plan, never the road user's motion: a manoeuvre that is blocked,
delayed or under way stays true while the plan still holds it. A source never writes false for a
road user whose plan it does not know. A change of declaration takes effect from the scene that
carries it, and a rule reads a declaration only at the observation it judges or before it, so a
later change never alters an earlier verdict or erases an obligation already triggered.

**Purpose, perception and imminent movement** — why a vehicle is stopped (loading, waiting for a
pedestrian, receiving passengers), what a driver perceived, knew or ascertained, a movement it is
about to make. These are not observable, and a rule is a check of conduct on a trace, so a span
that turns on one is read through the conduct or the outcome it governs: an imminent movement
("about to …") by the movement it leads to, a duty to perceive, ascertain or make sure by the outcome the check is there to secure
(the movement made with the clearances the reading sets), a purpose by the conduct it explains.
Who or what controls a vehicle — a person at the controls, an automated driving system, no one —
is not observable either: "drives", "operates" and "the driver" are read through the vehicle's
controlled motion, a vehicle moving on the road is taken to be driven, and the duty binds that
vehicle's conduct whoever or whatever controls it. Where the words offer observable evidence themselves, the rule reads that evidence (what was in an
actual road user's line of sight is `rel.visible`; what could be seen from or at a place is
`st.sight_distance`). Each such reading is disclosed on its span as a narrowing of kind
`observable_reading` with its category (`intention`, `perception`, `status`, `purpose`, `agency`): it is a
reading of the words, not an approximation by a neighbouring atom, and never an assumption or a
gap. A state of mind that shows in no conduct is outside what a trace can check, and a rule never
assumes one. The control state of
a vehicle — engine running, parking brake set, gear, throttle, service brake — is not of this
kind: it is observed on an instrumented vehicle and carried by the control-state atoms of §2,
under the `subject` capability where only the subject's vehicle is instrumented.

**Legal status of a feature on the road** — that a sign, a signal, a marking, an opening or a
crossing is official, posted or designated by an authority. The feature's presence on the road is
the observable evidence of that status: a rule reads the feature and presumes the status (an
`observable_reading` of category `status`). A category that no feature on the road displays is a
legal region class (above).

**A clearly marked stop line** — the words "clearly marked" said of a stop line the scene
represents. The line's presence is the evidence: a rule reads the represented stop line as the
clearly marked one (an `observable_reading` of category `status`), and the paint's clarity or wear
is not modelled. This reading never relaxes which stopping point governs, the action and its
timing, or the road users to yield to.

**Lawfulness of another road user's conduct** ("pedestrians lawfully within the crosswalk", "a
person lawfully riding") — a reference to another rule's verdict, expressed by rule composition in
Core, not by an atom.

**An act due at a place before an event: the approach** — where words require an act (a halt, a
yield) at a named place (a stop line, a crosswalk, the edge of an intersection) before an event the
words name (an entry into an intersection, the passing of a mark), and state no occurrence, timing
or exception of their own, the act is owed on the approach that leads to that event. The approach is
identified by the map and the event's target, never by the road user's motion: a road user's
approach to an intersection is a carrier it occupies whose entrance end is that intersection
(`st.lane_enters`), and a mark governs that approach where it is recorded as marking that carrier
(`st.entrance_of`); below, the mark is the named place, and where the place is the edge of the
intersection it is that carrier's entrance end. The approach starts at the last observation before
the event at which the road user, on a carrier the mark is recorded as marking, is outside the
mark's stopping zone upstream: off the mark, short of it, and farther from it than the stop-point
tolerance; where several marks of the place's kind mark that carrier, outside the zone of each and
short of each. The side of the mark is read along that carrier's designated
direction (`st.lane_direction`, by the sign of `prim.region_offset_along`), never along the road
user's heading; every distance to the mark, the tolerance and the zone's bound included, is the
distance between the road user's body and the mark (`st.region_geometry`). The stop-point tolerance is
one parameter the reading sets: the bound within which the act counts at the place is the bound
beyond which the road user is outside the zone, and a halt that lies within measurement noise of
that bound may be read on either side of it, the expected limit of this approximation. Where the
words place the act before the road user enters a region, a halt at which its footprint already
overlaps that region (`rel.occupies`) is not at the place, and the stop-point tolerance applies
outside that region only. A search for
the act runs back from the event and ends only at that approach start or at the previous occurrence
of the same event for the same road user and the same place; nothing else ends it: not another
intersection or mark, not the start of the recording, not a first observation, not a distance
travelled. Each occurrence of the event owes its own act: an act done before the previous
occurrence of the same event for the same road user and place discharged that occurrence, not the
new one; an entry and the passing of a mark are different events, each with its own occurrences. Only an observed exit from the stopping zone upstream begins a new approach, so a road
user that leaves the zone upstream and comes back owes the act again; crossing the mark, moving on
toward the event, a change of carrier or a lateral move within the same entry, a reverse that stays
within the zone, and speed noise begin no new approach, and none of them loses an act already done for the event still
to come.
Where the search finds the act, the duty is met; where it reaches either end without the act, the
duty is violated; only where it reaches neither end without finding the act is the duty unknown.
Whether the event occurred at an observation is read from that observation and the one before it: it
is unknown, never absent, where the one before does not show the road user's place relative to the
mark through its carrier, because there is no earlier observation of the road user (its recording
begins at that observation), it is on no mapped carrier, or it is on a carrier whose association
with the mark is not observed; where the one before shows it on a carrier the mark is observed not
to mark, or already within the region the event enters, it is not that mark's event. Which mark
governs is read through the same carrier: where a mark's association with that carrier is not
observed, whether the mark governs is unknown; where the mark's entrances are observed, so that its
list is complete, and exclude that carrier, the mark does not govern that approach, the duty's place
is read from the other places the words list, in their order, and the duty is not unknown on that
ground. Missing evidence makes the duty unknown only where the verdict depends on it: a recorded act at a place known
to govern, a duty that does not arise, and an association the source excludes are decided
whatever the missing fact would be; where the verdict does turn on a missing direction, association
or observation, the duty is unknown, never decided from a distance alone or from the absence of a
record. Words that state their own occurrence, timing or exception govern instead, written with
their own window. This reading fixes the time of a duty, a distinction of the driving task: it is a
modelling convention the operator adopts for the whole corpus, not an abstraction of an incidental
word, and it relaxes no check of which place governs, the act, or the road users it concerns.

**Concepts** (`drv`) — manoeuvres, states of motion, road configurations and relations between
road users over time (a stop, a turn, a pass, a following gap, a laned roadway) are not atoms.
They are concept nodes the pipeline defines over atoms, primitives and other concepts, each with a
contract of its own, accepted like a rule and called by id (`drv.<family>.<name>`); a rule never
rebuilds one inline.

**Dataset fields** — any edge label, trigger region, render distance, band label or node name of
a particular scene-graph format. These are how a source grounds an atom; they belong in the
adapter and its manifest, never in a rule.

## 10. Primitives (`prim`) — computations the formula language cannot express

A primitive is a geometric computation over atoms with no legal word in it, defined once in Core
with its parameters exposed. A concept or a rule calls it by id; the set is closed, and a need
for another is a gap for the operator, never a definition written during a run.

| id | contract | parameters | result unit | parameter units |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `prim.heading_change` | the signed heading change (degrees, left positive) of a road user over the window behind the observation, integrated from `kin.yaw_rate`; unknown where the window is truncated, sampled too sparsely, or a yaw rate is missing | the window length (time) | deg | s |
| `prim.closest_approach_within` | under constant velocities, the centres of two road users approach each other at some time between the observation and the horizon | the horizon (time) | boolean | s |
| `prim.closest_approach_time` | the time from the observation at which the two centres are closest, under constant velocities; undefined when they do not approach within the horizon | the horizon (time) | s | s |
| `prim.closest_approach_distance` | the centre distance at that closest approach; undefined when they do not approach within the horizon | the horizon (time) | m | s |
| `prim.conditions_hold` | the structured conditions of a device (`dev.zone_sign`, `dev.regulatory_sign`) hold at the observation for a road user: `env.civil_time` falls in one of its time windows on one of its days (a calendar class is an assumption), and any occupancy or class condition is met | — | boolean | — |
| `prim.region_lateral_offset` | the signed lateral offset (m, left positive) of a structure region from a road user: the component, perpendicular to the road user's heading, of the vector from its reference point to the point of the region's boundary nearest that reference point; zero where the reference point lies inside the region; where several boundary points are equally nearest, their common component, and undefined where their components differ; unknown where the position, the heading or the boundary is absent | — | m | — |
| `prim.region_offset_along` | the signed distance (m) from a road user's reference point (`kin.position`) to a structure region (`st.region_geometry`), measured along a carrier's designated direction (`st.lane_direction`) on the straight line through the reference point parallel to that direction. The region is a closed set: a vertex the line only touches and an edge it runs along are points of it the line meets. Zero where the reference point lies in the region or on its boundary; where every point of the region on that line lies ahead, the distance to the nearest of them (positive); where every one lies behind, minus the distance to the nearest (negative); where the line does not meet the region, the value comes from the region's projection on the direction, the interval [lo, hi] of the signed distances of its points along it: lo where lo > 0 (all of the region ahead), hi where hi < 0 (all behind) — a projection gap, not a distance along the line, so the value may jump where the line starts or stops meeting the region, while its sign gives the side in both cases; undefined where the line meets the region both ahead and behind (the reference point lies in an opening of the region), where it misses the region and [lo, hi] spans or touches zero, and where the boundary is not a simple polygon (empty, fewer than three vertices, zero area, or crossing or touching itself); unknown where the position, the direction (a zero vector included) or the boundary is absent; independent of the boundary's start vertex and orientation. The direction is read normalised as `st.lane_direction` is, with Core's micrometre-rounded square root, and the distance is counted in lengths of that normalised vector (between 1 and 1 + 2·10⁻⁶ m), so it carries that rounding. It is a geometric quantity only: it does not establish that the road user is on the carrier, that the region marks the carrier's entrance, that the whole body has crossed the region, or that a crossing happened between observations; a caller states those with its own relations, footprint occupancy and temporal formulas; a distance to the region is read from `st.region_geometry`, never from this value | — | m | — |

## 11. Units of the measured atoms

The unit of the value a formula reads from a measured atom, by the name a formula uses
(`Term.measure`); a vector atom's components share its unit. `1` marks a count, a ratio, a
direction or an ordinal, which carry no unit; `1/m` is a reciprocal length. A primitive's units are
the last two columns of §10. These units type a comparison: two sides of a comparison, of a sum
or of the branches of a selection have the same unit.

| id | measure | unit |
|---|---|---|
| `kin.time` | `kin_time` | s |
| `kin.position` | `kin_position` | m |
